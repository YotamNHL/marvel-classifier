## What's that
This tool lets you create a profile of a comic book character of your own, and in results it classifies your creation as a superhero or a supervillain.
<br/> The classification is based on an popular algorithm called Catboost, which in this case being used upon a complete Marvel Comicbooks' characters database.
<br/> Also, the user will also be told of the character that he is most similar too from those comics, in terms of his stats and super-powers.
